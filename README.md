# Male-transmitted transgenerational effects of the herbicide linuron on DNA methylation profiles in Xenopus tropicalis brain and testis

This repository contains the R code used in the analysis of RRBS data in the publication entitled [Male-transmitted transgenerational effects of the herbicide linuron on DNA methylation profiles in Xenopus tropicalis brain and testis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170949)
Raw RRBS fastq files have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number [PRJEB59360](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB59360)

The sequences were processed using the [Nextflow nf-core/methylseq pipeline version 1.6.1](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/1.6.1) using the following parameters

The code used for the analysis is ./code/Lin_F2_Brain+Testis.rmd
